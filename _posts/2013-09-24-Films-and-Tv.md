I watch a horrendous amount of films and tv. The majority hit the bar at terrible consisting of a pick-n-mix of swiss-cheese plots, cardboard acting and disillusioned direction.

Regardless, I find myself forced to watch because how do you know the good if you don't know the bad? That's my logic anyway.

So with a bit of inspiration from the flatmate, I decided I should start to blog about what I watch. This will serve to help me remember what was good and bad and also let me slag of the really shit parts of a movie. Or the whole thing (I'm looking at you 'Jobs').

I've created a subdomain for this at [thethingsiwatch.donalfarrell.com](http://thethingsiwatch.donalfarrell.com/). No content yet as i've a couple of things to finish off, but will hopefully be done soon.
