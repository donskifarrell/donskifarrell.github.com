title: GigSpotting Beta is ready to use

So I have deployed my other side project, [GigSpotting](http://www.gigspotting.co.uk), to the internets. 

The premise of the project is to allow a user to search for an artist and a location and have any relevant gigs show up on the map along with the date and additional details, such as supporting artists. As there may only be one or no results, similar artists are also searched and will appear alongside the original artists.

It is still in the very very early stages, but you can do a basic search (which is slooow) and artists will be plotted onto the map.
